* sort command in Linux

*sort* is a text-processing utility that:
- *Reads lines of text* (from file(s) or stdin).
- Orders them according to a chosen rule (lexicographic, numeric, month, version, locale-aware, etc.).
- Writes the sorted result to stdout (or optionally a file).
It’s line-based: each input line is a record.

*Basic Usage:*
#+begin_src
sort file.txt
sort file1.txt file2.txt
#+end_src
- Default: sorts lines lexicographically (dictionary order) based on current locale (LC_COLLATE).
- Multiple Files, Concatenates both and sorts as one input.


Internal Behavior
- *External Merge Sort*: For large files, *sort* uses temporary disk files to perform an external merge sort.
- *LC_COLLATE & LC_ALL*: Affects sort behavior based on locale. Use *LC_ALL=C* for byte-wise sort.
